# Zerita

Zerita is a feature-rich, expressive conlang, without any exceptions.

It is a VSO language, inspired by other latin-based languages for the
vocabulary, the writing system, and the pronunciation. As such, it uses
the latin alphabet to be written, it has 1-1 correspondence between the
written and the spoken form, and is meant to be easy for machines to
understand. Expressiveness comes with a steeper learning curve, but the
absence of exceptions make up for it.

## Brief overview of zerita

Zerita is meant to be a highly regular language, avoiding exceptions. It
also doesn't try to innovate on the phonetics, writing, and vocabulary,
as these are thought as the less substantial parts of a language.
Avoiding exceptions also makes it easy for machine parsing and science.

Zerita is easy, but extremely expressive. The design choice is always to
opt for the more expressive choice, even at the cost of making it more
complex, but not more complicated.

One other choice that is present throughout zeritan rule is the information
flow. Zerita is a language that is meant to be literal, and express the
necessary information. For example, in English, a sentence like
"The door was red", is strongly associated with the past state. The speaker
most probably means that the door was read in the past, but not any more.
Contrary, in Zerita, "Sisen ta portis ruje" means that the door was red,
but for the present state of the colour door, you cannot infer anything.

Even though zerita is using latin-based languages for the vocabulary,
the writing system, and the pronunciation, this isn't true for the grammar
and the syntax. Zerita is using all natural languages and conlangs as
inspiration, and is trying to be innovative on these two.
