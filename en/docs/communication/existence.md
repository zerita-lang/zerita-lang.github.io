# Existence

In zerita, there are three verbs are used to express existence:

- _exis_
- _viv_
- _stat_

## exis

The verb "exis" is used to express existence in a general sense.
It doesn't imply presence or absence, but rather the existence of something.

## viv and stat

The verbs "viv" and "stat" are used to express existence.
Their difference depends on the nature of the existence being expressed.
The verb "viv" is used to express existence in a dynamic sense, while "stat" is used to express existence in a static sense.
For example, "statave e silvis" and "vivave e silvis" both mean "There is a forest".
The difference between the two is that "viv" emphasises the dynamic nature of the forest, viewing is as a living organism that grows, lives, and decays while "stat" just states that the forest is there.
"stat" can be used for humans, animals, and plants, to express the presence of a person, animal, or plant.
Similarly, "viv" can be used for objects like a car, a river, or even a house to express their ever-changing nature.
