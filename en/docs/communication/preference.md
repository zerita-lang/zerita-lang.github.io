# Preference

Zerita has 4 main verbs to express preference.
The verbs are "amor" (love), "estim" (like), and the negative ones "hostil" (hate) and "avert" (dislike).
The negation can be used with the positive verbs to express a more nuanced meaning.

The order of likeness is as follows:

- **amor:** love
- **estim:** like
- **ne amor:** not love
- **ne estim:** not like
- **ne avert:** not dislike
- **ne hostil:** not hate
- **avert:** dislike
- **hostil:** hate

The "ne estim" and "ne avert" are used to express a neutral feeling, but still having a slight preference.

The verbs can be used with any person, but outside the first person singular, they are uncommon unless they are in the evidential mood or in a question.
