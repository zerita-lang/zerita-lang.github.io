# If clause variation

Factuality and necessity are included in the "if" particle in zerita.
For possible if clauses, the if particle is:

- **ce,** to express an implication that the if clause isn't a necessary condition
- **lo,** to express anankastics
- **celo,** to express both.

For counterfactuals, a "u" precedes the if particle.
Some examples will clarify the uses of each case:

1.  _uce savo riki, se obvend e auton._

    - **translation:** If I were rich, I would buy a car.
    - **explanation:** I may still buy it even though I'm not rich.

1.  _ucelo savo riki, se obvend e auton._

    - **translation:** If I were rich, I would buy a car.
    - **explanation:** I'm not rich, so I won't.

1.  _ulo savo riki, se obvend e auton._

    - **translation:** Only if I were rich, I would buy a car.
    - **explanation:** I'm not rich, so I won't, but even if I was I may not have bought one.

Zerita is a language that favours dropping information that isn't necessary for the discussion.
In this sense, "celo" and "ucelo" are only to be used when the necessity of the conditional must be conveyed, otherwise "ce" and "uce" are to be used.

## Examples

1.  _ce riduvo, se ridavur._

    - **translation:** When I laugh, everybody is laughing
    - **explanation:** When I laugh, can be viewed as "if I'm laughing, regardless of past, present, or future"

1.  _ce venovi al ta dome, se al edravi e cenon._

    - **translation:** If you come home, you'll eat dinner.
    - **explanation:** The speaker puts "venovi" in the future to specify that it's about a future event.
      The eat is in the present prospective, as to describe that upon arrival the dinner will start afterwards.
