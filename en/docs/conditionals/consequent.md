# Then clause variation

In zerita the then particle is mandatory in conditionals, even when it precedes the if clause.
There are the 3 different ways to express then:

- **si,** which is used when the conditional an scientific implication.
- **se,** which is used when the conditional the implication strength is strong.
- **su,** which is used when the conditional the implication strength is weaker.

## Examples

1.  _ce jogavos, se vinko._

    - **translation:** If we play, I will win.
    - **explanation:** "si" is reserved for proofs.

1.  _ce jogavos, su vinko._

    - **translation:** If we play, I expect to win.
    - **explanation:** "su" still means that this is the expected outcome.

# Else clause variation

In zerita the else clause isn't mandatory in conditionals, and conditionals that are introduced with "est" or "cest" cannot have an else clause.

- **eli,** which is used when the conditional an scientific implication. It can only be used with "celo" or "ucelo".
- **ele,** which is used when the conditional the implication strength is strong.
- **elu,** which is used when the conditional the implication strength is weaker.
