# Adjectives

Adjectives in zerita decline exactly the same as nouns do.
They are placed after the noun that the describe in order of importance, for example both mean "big new knife":

- _e koltis magnis novis_
- _e koltis novis magnis_

There is an slight difference in intention.
The first means that it's a big new knife, but the second means the knife is noticeably new, and maybe so shiny that you'll notice this first.

The number of the adjective always agrees with the nouns that it modifies:

- _e furkis ete e koklis magnesis_

    - **translation:** a big fork and a big spoon

- _e furkis ete e koklis magnis_

    - **translation:** a fork and a big spoon

## Examples

- _save ta domis magnis es beli._

    - **translation:** the big house is beautiful.

- _save ta domis es magni ete beli._

    - **translation:** the house is big and beautiful.
