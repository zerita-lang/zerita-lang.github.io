# Derived adverbs

Any adjective can be turned into an adverb, by using the "-ie" suffix:

- _bon_ -> _bónie_, well
- _mal_ -> _málie_, badly

The "-ie" suffix moves the stressed syllable once towards the end, but never to itself.

## Examples

1.  _kantaves bónie tas avisesis._

    - **translation:** The birds are singing well.
