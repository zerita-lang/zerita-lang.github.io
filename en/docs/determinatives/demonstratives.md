# Demonstratives

Zerita has three levels of deiksis:

- _est:_ close
- _ess:_ far
- _tis:_ very far, invisible

They can be combined with any interrogative:

- _ke:_ (who/what)

    - **close:** este (this)
    - **far:** esse (that)
    - **very far, invisible:** tise (the one that's out of my sight)

- _kuál:_ (which)

    - **close:** estuál (this one)
    - **far:** essuál (that one)
    - **very far, invisible:** tisuál (the one that's out of my sight)

- _kove:_ (where)

    - **close:** estove (here)
    - **far:** essove (there)
    - **very far, invisible:** tisove (the place that's out of my sight)

- _kuando:_ (when)

    - **close:** estondo (now)
    - **far:** essondo (the other time)
    - **very far, invisible:** tisondo (in a very distant time)

- _kuót:_ (how much/how many)

    - **close:** estót (this much)
    - **far:** essót (that much)
    - **very far, invisible:** tisót (that much)

- _kume:_ (how)

    - **close:** estume (this way)
    - **far:** essume (that way)
    - **very far, invisible:** tisume (that way)

When it's possible to combine them with a noun, the demonstrative must agree with the noun in number.
"-ove", "-uando", and "-ume" aren't demostratives, but they are mentioned here as they are closely related to the demonstratives.

## Cases

Demonstratives don't have a case, when used with a noun, to avoid redundancy.
But when they are used instead of a noun, the case marking is mandatory.

## "ess" or "tis"

The difference between "ess" and "tis" is that "tis" is used when the object is not visible, but the line is blurry for the "-ando" form.
The general rule is "essando" is used when the time is within a lifetime, and "tisando" for a more distant time.

## Examples

1. _este pomis_

    - **translation:** This apple

1. _volavo este pomon._

    - **translation:** I want this apple.
    - **explanation:** Using the demonstrative with a noun, so no case marking.

1. _volavo esseon._

    - **translation:** I want that.
    - **explanation:** Using the demonstrative instead of a noun,
      so the case marking is required.

1. _estes pomesis_

    - **translation:** These apples

1. _esses pomesis_

    - **translation:** Those apples

1. _estuál pomis_

    - **translation:** This one apple (when choosing between apples)

1. _estót akvis_

    - **translation:** This much water
