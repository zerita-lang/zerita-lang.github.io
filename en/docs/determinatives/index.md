# Determinatives

Determinatives are words that precede a noun, and there role is to provide additional information about the item are referring to.

There are 6 grammatical forms that can function as the determinative in zerita:

- [articles][article]: _the_ tree, _an_ apple
- [demonstrative determiners][demonstrative determiner]: _this_ machine, _that_ person
- [interrogative determiners][interrogative determiner]: _which_ book, _what_ blanket
- [possessives][possessive]: _Maria's_ bag, _my_ bed
- [quantifiers][quantifier]: _a few_ dogs, _each_ child
- [numerals][numeral]: _two_ dolphins, _a million_ dollars

It's important to note that determinatives can be combined, as in "_the three_ musketeers".

In zerita a determinative is mandatory, unless the noun is in the abstract form, the zero, or the collective number, where no determinative should be used.
For proper nouns a determinative isn't necessary but it can be used in the to change the specificity.
