# Possessives

Zerita is using the preposition "de" or "du" to indicate possession.
The possessive is used as a determiner, and it is placed before the noun.
Chaining possessives is possible, and the order of possessives is that the possessor comes before the possessed.

The difference between "de" and "du" is that "de" is for inalienable possession, while "du" is for alienable possession.
Inalienable possession is when the possessor is an integral part of the possessed, while alienable possession is when the possessor is not an integral part of the possessed.

There are no possessive pronouns in zerita, and they are expressed by "de" or "du" + pronoun.
