# Quantifiers

Quantifiers are determinatives that indicate the quantity of a noun.
The nullar and collective numbers make the "all" and "none" redundant.
The quantifiers are:

- _poko:_ a few
- _aliame:_ some (can be one)
- _oliame:_ some (cannot be one)
- _multe:_ many
- _kiska:_ each

"aliame", even though it can be one, it is used with the plural form of the noun.
"kiska" is used with the singular form of the noun.
"kiska" can also be used with the collective form of the noun, to emphasize both the individual and the group.

The quantifiers cannot be used with uncountable nouns, as the number already indicates the quantity.

## Examples

1. _edravur puereris e pomon_

    - **translation:** every child is eating an apple
    - **explanation:** "puereris" is the collective form of the noun, and the verb is in the collective form.
      The emphasis is on the children as a group.

1. _edrave kiska pueris e pomon_

    - **translation:** each child is eating an apple
    - **explanation:** "kiska" is used with the singular form of the noun, and the verb is in the singular form.
      The emphasis is on the individual child.

1. _edravur kiska puereris e pomon_

    - **translation:** each and every child is eating an apple
    - **explanation:** "kiska" is used with the collective form of the noun, and the verb is in the collective form.
      The emphasis is both on the individual child, and the children as a group.
