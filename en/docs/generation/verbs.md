# Verbs

## Passive verbs

In zerita the base transitive verbs are always active, and describe an action from the subject.
There is neither a "take" nor a "buy" verb.
The object promotion allows creating such verbs.

- **IO promotion:** "re-" prefix
- **DO promotion:** "ob-" prefix

1.  _potavo e akvon._

    - **translation:** I'm drinking water.

1.  _repotave e akvis meic._

    - **translation:** Water is being drunk by me.

1.  _donavo ta libron veim._

    - **translation:** I am giving the book to you.

1.  _redonave ta libris meic veim._

    - **translation:** The book is being given from me to you.

1.  _obdonavis ta libron meic._

    - **translation:** You are receiving a book from me.

## Reflexivity

Base verbs are also never reflexive or reciprocal.
A prefix changes the verb in a reflexive or a reciprocal form.

- **reflexive:** "aut-" prefix
- **reciprocal:** "kon-" prefix

1.  _autamores adamo ete maria._

    - **translation:** Adam and Maria love themselves.

1.  _konamores adamo ete maria._

    - **translation:** Adam and Maria love each other.

An important case is the generation of verbs like "to trade", from "to sell".

## Senses

Base sense verbs are used when the subject has the ability to perform the action.
Zerita can generate verbs via prefix that are used when the subject active uses their sense.
This is analogous to "to see" -> "to watch".

Zerita also allows creating intrasitive verbs for senses.
This is analogous to "to hear" -> "to sound".

- **voluntary action:** "vol-" prefix
- **intrasitive:** "per-" prefix

1.  _vidavo e peskis._

    - **translation:** I see a fish.

1.  _volaudavo e kanto._

    - **translation:** I am listening to a song.

1.  _perolfave ta uovis malie._

    - **translation:** The egg smells bad.
