# Form

There are 4 forms in Zerita.
These forms are formed by adding a suffix to the root word.
Using "libr", which is the word for "book", the suffixes are:

- **Default form:** no suffix, it doesn't have any special meaning: libr (a book)
- **Collective form:** "-as", used for collections of things: libras (a pile of books)
- **Abstract form:** "-at", used for abstract things: librat (a book in the abstract sense)
- **Cultural form:** "-an", used for cultural artifacts: libran (a culturally significant book)

!!! note "Abstract form"

    The abstract form is used to convey the meaning of an item in a non-concrete sense, as a general concept.
    For example, using it in a sentence like "I like pizza":
    we're not talking about a pizza, or a specific pizza, but pizza in general.
    This is in contrast to "I would like a pizza", where we talk about eating the food called pizza itself.
    Other examples include "Love is important" vs "Give me your love" where the first example is talking about love as a general concept, and the second is talking about a concrete instance of love.
