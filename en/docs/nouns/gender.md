# Gender

Zerita is not a gendered language.
The gender has no affect on the grammatical rules, it's only used to signify the gender of the object, and it's only used when it's relevant.
It's marked by the prefixes "vi-" and "me-", for the male and the female counterparts, respectively.

!!! note "Using gender"

    By default, unless you want to specify a gender, no gender prefix should be used.
    For example, if you have a son, you should use "fil" unless you specifically want to indicate that your child is a son rather than a daughter.

## Examples

1.  _Parent_

    - **Any gender:** paren
    - **Father:** viparen
    - **Mother:** meparen

1.  _Child (offspring)_

    - **Any gender:** fil
    - **Son:** vifil
    - **Daughter:** mefil
