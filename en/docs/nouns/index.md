# Nouns

Nouns is the most central part of the speech in order to understand the zerita language.
They have a lot of the intricacies of the language, therefore we will start with them.

Nouns in Zerita have 4 [forms][form], 5 [numbers][number] and 7 [cases][case].
The order of the prefixes and suffixes is: gender - base - form - number - case.

The [gender][gender], form, and number are the semantic parts of a zeritan noun, and the case is purely syntactical.

[gender]: ./gender.md
[form]: ./form.md
[number]: ./number.md
[case]: ./cases.md
