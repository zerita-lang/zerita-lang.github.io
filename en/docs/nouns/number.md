# Number

Numbers are formed by adding a suffix to the root word.
The semantic meaning of the suffix is different depending whether the noun is countable or uncountable.

### Countable nouns

Countable nouns are nouns that can be counted by an integer: apples, kilograms, humans.
Using "pom", which is the word for "apple", the suffixes are:

- **Singular:** No suffix, used for one item: pom (an apple)
- **Fractional:** "-ed" suffix, used for less than one: pomed (part of an apple)
- **Plural:** "-es" suffix, used for more than one item: pomes (apples)
- **Nullar:** "-en" suffix, used for no items: pomen (no apples)
- **Collective:** "-er" suffix, used for all items: pomer (all apples)

Singular is used for exactly one, fractional for strictly between zero and one, zero for none, and any number more than 1 is plural (even when it's not full two items).
Negative numbers use the number that would have been used by the number with the same absolute value.

### Uncountable nouns

Uncountable nouns are nouns that they don't have units: water, money, love.
Using "amor", which is the word for "love", the suffixes and their meanings are:

- **Singular:** No suffix, used when no quantity is specified: amor (love)
- **Fractional:** "-ed" suffix, used for a small quantity: amored (a little bit of love)
- **Plural:** "-es" suffix, used for a large quantity: amores (whole lotta love)
- **Nullar:** "-en" suffix, used for the absence: amoren (no love)
- **Collective:** "-er" suffix, used for the totality: amorer (all the love)
