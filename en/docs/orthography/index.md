!!! warning "Pronunciation"

    Each letter's pronunciation is meant to be as in the IPA, and it doesn't match 100% the english sounds.
    The English equivalent is just the closest sound in English (when the word is pronounced with the received pronunciation).

Zerita is also using the acute "`´`" as an accent.
A word without an acute will have its penultimate syllable stressed, or the only syllable if the word has a single syllable.
If a single acute is present, it signifies the stressed syllable.
For example, "homis" (human or person) has the "o" as the stressed vowel, "ni" (no) has the "i" stressed, but "asé" (3rd person pronoun) has the "e" stressed.

Zerita is using no capitalisation of the letters, no diphthongs, and no silent letters.
It uses the following punctuation marks:

| Mark | Name             | Usage                                                                              |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .    | Period           | Indicates the end of a declarative sentence.                                       |
| ;    | Semicolon        | Connects closely related independent clauses or separates items in a complex list. |
| ,    | Comma            | Separates elements in a list, clauses, or phrases within a sentence.               |
| :    | Colon            | Introduces a list, quotation, or explanation.                                      |
| !    | Exclamation Mark | Expresses strong emotion or a command.                                             |
| ?    | Question Mark    | Indicates a question.                                                              |
| ""   | Quotation Marks  | Encloses direct speech, quotations, or titles of works.                            |

Zerita uses hyphens for words that form a single lexeme, and apostrophes for contractions.
A single quote can be used instead of an apostrophe in typing, for easier typing.

!!! note "Punctuation and quotes"

    Punctuation marks should be placed only outside the double quotes if they both the sentence inside the quotes and outside of it end at the same time.

Names that come from other languages keep the original spelling if they are written in the latin alphabet, or they have a standard latinisation, and they written phonetically otherwise.
Even though they keep the spelling, they are still pronounced as close as possible to the original language.
As an aid to the reader, a name that comes from another language can be transliterated in Zerita inside square brackets, the first time it appears in a passage, for example "george[jorj]".
