# Questions

Questions in zerita are formed by the question particle + the sentence, in the affirmative syntax, with the unknown part missing.
Yes/no questions, in spoken zerita, have a rising intonation at the end of a sentence.

## Question particles

| Particle | English           | Meaning          |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| ku       |                   | yes/no question  |
| ke       | who/what          | generic question |
| ku치l     | which             | choice           |
| kove     | where             | location         |
| kuando   | when              | time             |
| ku칩t     | how much/how many | quantity         |
| kume     | how               | manner           |

The particles also use the preposition/postposition and declension that is expected.

Interrogative words can be combined with prepositions, for example "pro ke", to ask why something is happening (purpose), or "por ke" to ask for whose benefit something is happening.

!!! note "Handling unknowns"

    In zerita, asking for something, causes the affected suffixes to drop.
    For example, "kuanto" causes the time suffix to drop, or "ku칩t" causes the number suffix or the noun to drop.
    Similarly, "ke" when used to ask for the subject of the verb, it makes the person suffix to drop.

## Examples

1.  _ku donavi ta libron meim?_

    - **translation:** Are you giving the book to me?

1.  _kume donavi ta libron meim?_

    - **translation:** How are you giving the book to me?
    - **explanation:** Asking about the method of delivery, eg are you posting it by hand?

    - **translation:** Where are you giving the book to me?

Asking for the subject of the verb keeps only the known parts:

1.  _keis donav ta libron meim?_

    - **translation:** Who is giving the book to me?
    - **explanation:** I have no indication about who or how many people are giving me the book.

1.  _kemis donaves ta libron meim?_

    - **translation:** Who is giving the book to me?
    - **explanation:** I know that they are multiple people, not including you or me, so it's 3rd person plural.

1.  _keimis donavis ta libron meim?_

    - **translation:** Who are you (plural), who is giving the book to me?
    - **explanation:** It can be as a follow up question to "Donavos ta libron veim", but who is in included is unclear.

Some common questions include:

1.  _ki seve de ve namis?_

    - **translation:** What's your name?

1.  _kume savi?_

    - **translation:** How are you?

1.  _eks kove sevi?_
