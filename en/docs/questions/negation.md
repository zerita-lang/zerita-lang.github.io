# Negation

"ni" is used as the negative particle, but to negate a sentence, or a part of it, "ne" is used.

## Examples

1. _ni, ne donavi ta libron meim._

    - **translation:** No, you are not giving the book to me.

1. _donavi ne ta libron meim._

    - **translation:** You are not giving the book to me.
    - **explanation:** You're giving me something else.
