# Aspect

In zerita there are 9 aspects, which are used to indicate how the verb's action extends over time.
In zerita the aspect is expressed by an aspect word, that precedes the verb.
The aspect word doesn't have a meaning by itself, but it's a part of the verb.

## Parts of the aspect

The first part of the aspect word is similar to perfect tenses in English:

- **Perfect:** "il", used for actions that have finished
- **Prospective:** "al", used for actions that haven't started yet

The second part of the aspect word is concerned with the continuity:

- **Continuous:** "um", used for actions run continuously
- **Iterative:** "em", used for actions that run on intervals, or as a habit
