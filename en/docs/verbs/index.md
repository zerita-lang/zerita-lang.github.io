# Verbs

Zeritan verbs dictate the form of the sentence, the main syntax, as it depends strongly on the [verb type][type], and convey a lot of information through the prefix and suffix system.

Zeritan verbs have 8 [moods][mood], 5 [tenses][tense], and 9 [aspects][aspect].
As zerita has a nullar and collective number, there are 4 grammatical [persons][person] to accommodate this.

[aspect]: ./aspect.md
[mood]: ./mood.md
[tense]: ./tense.md
[type]: ./type.md
[person]: ./person.md
