# Mood

In zerita, moods are split the the moods in two groups, the main and the secondary.
The main moods cannot be combined between them, but they can be combined with secondary moods.
Unless combined, moods in zerita are formed by changing the consonant of the tense suffix.

## Main moods

### Indicative mood

The indicative mood is used to express facts, and it's using the consonant "v".

### Imperative mood

Imperative mood is used to express commands, and it's using the consonants "nt".

### Obligative Mood

The obligative mood expresses necessity or obligation, and it's using the consonant "d".
It's also used to express duty, destiny, or social obligation.
Duty and social obligation use the veritas tense, and destiny uses the simple future.

Negating a verb in the obligative mood means that you don't have the obligation, rather than meaning you must not perform the action.

### Permissive Mood

The permissive mood expresses the action of the verb is permitted, and it's using the consonant "m".

### Potential Mood

The potential mood expresses the ability or possibility to do something, and it's using the consonant "p".

## Secondary moods

Secondary moods can be combined.
Combination works by adding extra tense suffixes.

### Optative Mood

The optative mood expresses wishes, desires, or hopes, and it's using the consonant "f".

### Dubitative mood

The dubitative mood expresses doubt or scepticism about the action, and it's using the consonant "r".

### Evidential mood
