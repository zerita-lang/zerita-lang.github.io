# Person

In Zerita, there are 4 persons: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
The 4th person is used to describe total cases, such as zero and collective numbers.
Additionally, the 1st person plural has two forms: inclusive and exclusive.

The person and number suffixes are:

| Person/Number | Singular | Fractional | Plural | Nullar | Collective |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| 1st           | -o       |            | -os    |        |            |
| 1st (inc)     |          |            | -as    |        |            |
| 2nd           | -i       |            | -is    |        |            |
| 3rd           | -e       | -ed        | -es    |        |            |
| 4th           |          |            |        | -un    | -ur        |

Zerita is a pro-drop language, so the pronouns aren't necessary, and should only be used if emphasis is required.
