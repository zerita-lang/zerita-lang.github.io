# <x-trans>Existence</x-trans>

<x-trans>In zerita, there are three verbs are used to express existence:</x-trans>

- _&{exis}_
- _&{viv}_
- _&{stat}_

## &{exis}

<x-trans>The verb "&{exis}" is used to express existence in a general sense.</x-trans>
<x-trans>It doesn't imply presence or absence, but rather the existence of something.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>&{viv} and &{stat}</x-trans>

<x-trans>The verbs "&{viv}" and "&{stat}" are used to express existence.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Their difference depends on the nature of the existence being expressed.</x-trans>
<x-trans>The verb "&{viv}" is used to express existence in a dynamic sense, while "&{stat}" is used to express existence in a static sense.</x-trans>
<x-trans>For example, "&{statave e silvis}" and "&{vivave e silvis}" both mean "There is a forest".</x-trans>
<x-trans>The difference between the two is that "&{viv}" emphasises the dynamic nature of the forest, viewing is as a living organism that grows, lives, and decays while "&{stat}" just states that the forest is there.</x-trans>
<x-trans>"&{stat}" can be used for humans, animals, and plants, to express the presence of a person, animal, or plant.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Similarly, "&{viv}" can be used for objects like a car, a river, or even a house to express their ever-changing nature.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Differences between "&{viv}"/"&{stat}" and "&{exis}"</x-trans>
