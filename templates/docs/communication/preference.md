# <x-trans>Preference</x-trans>

<x-trans>Zerita has 4 main verbs to express preference.</x-trans>
<x-trans>The verbs are "&{amor}" (love), "&{estim}" (like), and the negative ones "&{hostil}" (hate) and "&{avert}" (dislike).</x-trans>
<x-trans>The negation can be used with the positive verbs to express a more nuanced meaning.</x-trans>

<x-trans>The order of likeness is as follows:</x-trans>

- **&{amor}:** <x-trans>love</x-trans>
- **&{estim}:** <x-trans>like</x-trans>
- **&{ne amor}:** <x-trans>not love</x-trans>

- **&{ne hostil}:** <x-trans>not hate</x-trans>
- **&{avert}:** <x-trans>dislike</x-trans>
- **&{hostil}:** <x-trans>hate</x-trans>

<x-trans>The "&{ne estim}" and "&{ne avert}" are used to express a neutral feeling, but still having a slight preference.</x-trans>
