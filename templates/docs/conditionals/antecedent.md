# <x-trans>If clause variation</x-trans>

<x-trans>Factuality and necessity are included in the "if" particle in zerita.</x-trans>
<x-trans>For possible if clauses, the if particle is:</x-trans>

- **&{ce},** <x-trans>to express an implication that the if clause isn't a necessary condition</x-trans>
- **&{lo},** <x-trans>to express anankastics</x-trans>
- **&{celo},** <x-trans>to express both.</x-trans>

<x-trans>For counterfactuals, a "&{u}" precedes the if particle.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Some examples will clarify the uses of each case:</x-trans>

1.  _&{uce savo riki, se obvend e auton.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>If I were rich, I would buy a car.</x-trans>
    - **<x-trans>explanation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>I may still buy it even though I'm not rich.</x-trans>

1.  _&{ucelo savo riki, se obvend e auton.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>If I were rich, I would buy a car.</x-trans>
    - **<x-trans>explanation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>I'm not rich, so I won't.</x-trans>

1.  _&{ulo savo riki, se obvend e auton.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>Only if I were rich, I would buy a car.</x-trans>
    - **<x-trans>explanation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>I'm not rich, so I won't, but even if I was I may not have bought one.</x-trans>

<x-trans>Zerita is a language that favours dropping information that isn't necessary for the discussion.</x-trans>
<x-trans>In this sense, "&{celo}" and "&{ucelo}" are only to be used when the necessity of the conditional must be conveyed, otherwise "&{ce}" and "&{uce}" are to be used.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Examples</x-trans>

1.  _&{ce riduvo, se ridavur.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>When I laugh, everybody is laughing</x-trans>
    - **<x-trans>explanation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>When I laugh, can be viewed as "if I'm laughing, regardless of past, present, or future"</x-trans>

1.  _&{ce venovi al ta dome, se al edravi e cenon.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>If you come home, you'll eat dinner.</x-trans>
    - **<x-trans>explanation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>The speaker puts "&{venovi}" in the future to specify that it's about a future event.</x-trans>
      <x-trans>The eat is in the present prospective, as to describe that upon arrival the dinner will start afterwards.</x-trans>
