# <x-trans>Then clause variation</x-trans>

<x-trans>In zerita the then particle is mandatory in conditionals, even when it precedes the if clause.</x-trans>
<x-trans>There are the &{3} different ways to express then:</x-trans>

- **&{si},** <x-trans>which is used when the conditional an scientific implication.</x-trans>
- **&{se},** <x-trans>which is used when the conditional the implication strength is strong.</x-trans>
- **&{su},** <x-trans>which is used when the conditional the implication strength is weaker.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Examples</x-trans>

1.  _&{ce jogavos, se vinko.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>If we play, I will win.</x-trans>
    - **<x-trans>explanation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>"&{si}" is reserved for proofs.</x-trans>

1.  _&{ce jogavos, su vinko.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>If we play, I expect to win.</x-trans>
    - **<x-trans>explanation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>"&{su}" still means that this is the expected outcome.</x-trans>

# <x-trans>Else clause variation</x-trans>

<x-trans>In zerita the else clause isn't mandatory in conditionals, and conditionals that are introduced with "&{est}" or "&{cest}" cannot have an else clause.</x-trans>

- **eli,** <x-trans>which is used when the conditional an scientific implication.</x-trans> <x-trans>It can only be used with "&{celo}" or "&{ucelo}".</x-trans>
- **ele,** <x-trans>which is used when the conditional the implication strength is strong.</x-trans>
- **elu,** <x-trans>which is used when the conditional the implication strength is weaker.</x-trans>
