# <x-trans>Conditionals</x-trans>

<x-trans>Zerita has a rich conditionals system.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Some of the following aren't true conditionals in zerita, but they are listed here, as they are expressed via a conditional in many other languages.</x-trans>

- **<x-trans>Implications</x-trans>,** <x-trans>which are used to express a direction implication:</x-trans>
    - <x-trans>If the water reaches 100°C in 1 atm, it boils</x-trans>
- **<x-trans>Definitions</x-trans>,** <x-trans>which are used for definition:</x-trans>
    - <x-trans>A number bigger than 1 is called prime, if it's only divisible by 1 and itself</x-trans>
- **<x-trans>Anankastics</x-trans>,** <x-trans>which are used to describe a necessity:</x-trans>
    - <x-trans>If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends</x-trans>
- **<x-trans>Biscuit conditionals</x-trans>,** <x-trans>where the the truth of the then clause does not depend on the truth of the if clause:</x-trans>
    - <x-trans>There are biscuits on the table, if you want some</x-trans>
- **<x-trans>Counterfactuals</x-trans>,** <x-trans>where the if clause is false or impossible:</x-trans>
    - <x-trans>If I were a rich man, all day long I'd biddy biddy bum</x-trans>
    - <x-trans>If I had studied more, I would have passed the exams</x-trans>
- **<x-trans>Anderson Case</x-trans>,** <x-trans>which are used as part of an argument for the truth of its if clause:</x-trans>
    - <x-trans>If Jones had taken arsenic, he would not have shown just exactly those symptoms which he does show.</x-trans>
- **<x-trans>Predictive</x-trans>,** <x-trans>where the if clause is a possibility:</x-trans>
    - <x-trans>If we work hard, we will finish the project on time</x-trans>

<x-trans>In zerita, conditionals follow a different paradigm:</x-trans>

<x-trans>A zeritan conditional is a multi-part sentence.</x-trans>
<x-trans>There isn't a main and a subordinate sentence, as in most languages, but all parts of them form a sentence with multiple verbs.</x-trans>

<x-trans>The tenses follow a temporal order, ie the tense of the then clause is relevant to the tense of the if clause.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Factuality</x-trans>

<x-trans>The first distinction is based on the factuality of the if clause.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Is it a possibility or is it counterfactual?</x-trans>

- **<x-trans>counterfactual</x-trans>,** <x-trans>is an if clause that is or cannot be true.</x-trans>
    - <x-trans>an alternative past:</x-trans> <x-trans>If I had studied more</x-trans> (<x-trans>but I hadn't and I cannot change that</x-trans>)
    - <x-trans>an impossible situation:</x-trans> <x-trans>If I could land this spacecraft on the sun</x-trans> (<x-trans>but it's not possible</x-trans>)
    - <x-trans>an imaginary situation:</x-trans> <x-trans>If you were here</x-trans> (<x-trans>but you're somewhere else</x-trans>)
- **<x-trans>possibility</x-trans>,** <x-trans>is an if clause that can be true</x-trans>
    - <x-trans>a future, unknown event:</x-trans> <x-trans>If I come home early</x-trans> (<x-trans>I may come early, I may not</x-trans>)
    - <x-trans>a "placeholder" case:</x-trans> <x-trans>If n in an even number</x-trans> (<x-trans>it depends on n</x-trans>)
    - <x-trans>an unknown:</x-trans> <x-trans>If you had been here</x-trans> (<x-trans>I don't know if you were, I'm trying to explore whether it's possible</x-trans>)

## <x-trans>Necessity</x-trans>

<x-trans>The second distinction is the necessity of the if clause, ie whether the if clause is also a necessary condition for the main clause to happen.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Anankastics are also expressed in the if clause.</x-trans>
<x-trans>As in the other parts of zerita, we use the non-necessary form, unless we want to specifically include it.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Essentially, we differentiate between:</x-trans>

- <x-trans>If I work hard, I will be able to afford a new car</x-trans>

<x-trans>A complete conditional means that if I don't work hard, I won't be able to afford a new car, but an incomplete one indicates that I can still afford a new car, even if we don't work time, but with other means, for example by winning the lottery.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Implication strength</x-trans>

<x-trans>The third distinction is the strength of the implication of the conditional.</x-trans>
<x-trans>If the if clause is true, how probable is for the then clause to happen?</x-trans>
<x-trans>Consider the following sentences:</x-trans>

- <x-trans>If the water reaches 100°C in 1 atm, it boils</x-trans>
- <x-trans>If you exercise regularly, you'll live more</x-trans>
- <x-trans>If I win the lottery, I'll buy a Ferrari</x-trans>

<x-trans>The first is a fact.</x-trans>
<x-trans>If the water reaches 100°C in 1 atm, it has no other option that to start boiling.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Maybe you can boil it in another way (eg in vacuum), but when the if clause is true then the then clause will necessarily happen.</x-trans>

<x-trans>The second is a strong association but not a necessity; you mean exercise, but not reach an old age from another reason.</x-trans>
<x-trans>But the probabilities are with you.</x-trans>

<x-trans>The third one is a weaker association.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Winning the lottery may change my priorities, although the most probable outcome is still that I'll buy a Ferrari.</x-trans>
