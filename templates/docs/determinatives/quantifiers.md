# <x-trans>Quantifiers</x-trans>

<x-trans>Quantifiers are determinatives that indicate the quantity of a noun.</x-trans>
<x-trans>The nullar and collective numbers make the "all" and "none" redundant.</x-trans>
<x-trans>The quantifiers are:</x-trans>

- _&{poko}:_ <x-trans>a few</x-trans>
- _&{aliame}:_ <x-trans>some (can be one)</x-trans>
- _&{oliame}:_ <x-trans>some (cannot be one)</x-trans>
- _&{multe}:_ <x-trans>many</x-trans>
- _&{kiska}:_ <x-trans>each</x-trans>

<x-trans>"&{aliame}", even though it can be one, it is used with the plural form of the noun.</x-trans>
<x-trans>"&{kiska}" is used with the singular form of the noun.</x-trans>
<x-trans>"&{kiska}" can also be used with the collective form of the noun, to emphasize both the individual and the group.</x-trans>

<x-trans>The quantifiers cannot be used with uncountable nouns, as the number already indicates the quantity.</x-trans>
