# <x-trans>Zerita</x-trans>

<x-trans>Zerita is a feature-rich, expressive conlang, without any exceptions.</x-trans>

<x-trans>It is a VSO language, inspired by other latin-based languages for the vocabulary, the writing system, and the pronunciation.</x-trans>
<x-trans>As such, it uses the latin alphabet to be written, it has 1-1 correspondence between the written and the spoken form, and is meant to be easy for machines to understand.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Expressiveness comes with a steeper learning curve, but the absence of exceptions make up for it.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Brief overview of zerita</x-trans>

<x-trans>Zerita is meant to be a highly regular language, avoiding exceptions.</x-trans>
<x-trans>It also doesn't try to innovate on the phonetics, writing, and vocabulary, as these are thought as the less substantial parts of a language.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Avoiding exceptions also makes it easy for machine parsing and science.</x-trans>

<x-trans>Zerita is easy, but extremely expressive.</x-trans>
<x-trans>The design choice is always to opt for the more expressive choice, even at the cost of making it more complex, but not more complicated.</x-trans>

<x-trans>One other choice that is present throughout zeritan rule is the information flow.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Zerita is a language that is meant to be literal, and express the necessary information.</x-trans>
<x-trans>For example, in English, a sentence like "The door was red", is strongly associated with the past state.</x-trans>
<x-trans>The speaker most probably means that the door was read in the past, but not any more.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Contrary, in Zerita, "&{sive ta portis ruji}" means that the door was red, but for the present state of the colour door, you cannot infer anything.</x-trans>

<x-trans>Even though zerita is using latin-based languages for the vocabulary, the writing system, and the pronunciation, this isn't true for the grammar and the syntax.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Zerita is using all natural languages and conlangs as inspiration, and is trying to be innovative on these two.</x-trans>
