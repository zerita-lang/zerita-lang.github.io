# <x-trans>Form</x-trans>

<x-trans>There are 4 forms in Zerita.</x-trans>
<x-trans>These forms are formed by adding a suffix to the root word.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Using "&{libr}", which is the word for "book", the suffixes are:</x-trans>

- **<x-trans>Default form</x-trans>:** <x-trans>no suffix, it doesn't have any special meaning:</x-trans> &{libr} (<x-trans>a book</x-trans>)
- **<x-trans>Collective form</x-trans>:** <x-trans>"&{-as}", used for collections of things:</x-trans> &{libras} (<x-trans>a pile of books</x-trans>)
- **<x-trans>Abstract form</x-trans>:** <x-trans>"&{-at}", used for abstract things:</x-trans> &{librat} (<x-trans>a book in the abstract sense</x-trans>)
- **<x-trans>Cultural form</x-trans>:** <x-trans>"&{-an}", used for cultural artifacts:</x-trans> &{libran} (<x-trans>a culturally significant book</x-trans>)

!!! note "<x-trans>Abstract form</x-trans>"

    <x-trans>The abstract form is used to convey the meaning of an item in a non-concrete sense, as a general concept.</x-trans>
    <x-trans>For example, using it in a sentence like "I like pizza":</x-trans>
    <x-trans>we're not talking about a pizza, or a specific pizza, but pizza in general.</x-trans>
    <x-trans>This is in contrast to "I would like a pizza", where we talk about eating the food called pizza itself.</x-trans>
    <x-trans>Other examples include "Love is important" vs "Give me your love" where the first example is talking about love as a general concept, and the second is talking about a concrete instance of love.</x-trans>
