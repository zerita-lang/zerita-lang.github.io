<x-trans>"&{ks}" is always written as "&{x}".</x-trans>

!!! warning "<x-trans>Pronunciation</x-trans>"

    <x-trans>Each letter's pronunciation is meant to be as in the IPA, and it doesn't match 100% the english sounds.</x-trans>
    <x-trans>The English equivalent is just the closest sound in English (when the word is pronounced with the received pronunciation).</x-trans>

<x-trans>Zerita is also using the acute "`&{´}`" as an accent.</x-trans>
<x-trans>A word without an acute will have its penultimate syllable stressed, or the only syllable if the word has a single syllable.</x-trans>
<x-trans>If a single acute is present, it signifies the stressed syllable.</x-trans>
<x-trans>For example, "&{homis}" (human or person) has the "&{o}" as the stressed vowel, "&{ni}" (no) has the "&{i}" stressed, but "&{asé}" (3rd person pronoun) has the "&{e}" stressed.</x-trans>

<x-trans>Zerita is using no capitalisation of the letters, no diphthongs, and no silent letters.</x-trans>
<x-trans>It uses the following punctuation marks:</x-trans>

| <x-trans>Mark</x-trans> | <x-trans>Name</x-trans>             | <x-trans>Usage</x-trans>                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .                       | <x-trans>Period</x-trans>           | <x-trans>Indicates the end of a declarative sentence.</x-trans>                                       |
| ;                       | <x-trans>Semicolon</x-trans>        | <x-trans>Connects closely related independent clauses or separates items in a complex list.</x-trans> |
| ,                       | <x-trans>Comma</x-trans>            | <x-trans>Separates elements in a list, clauses, or phrases within a sentence.</x-trans>               |
| :                       | <x-trans>Colon</x-trans>            | <x-trans>Introduces a list, quotation, or explanation.</x-trans>                                      |
| !                       | <x-trans>Exclamation Mark</x-trans> | <x-trans>Expresses strong emotion or a command.</x-trans>                                             |
| ?                       | <x-trans>Question Mark</x-trans>    | <x-trans>Indicates a question.</x-trans>                                                              |
| ""                      | <x-trans>Quotation Marks</x-trans>  | <x-trans>Encloses direct speech, quotations, or titles of works.</x-trans>                            |

<x-trans>Zerita uses hyphens for words that form a single lexeme, and apostrophes for contractions.</x-trans>
<x-trans>A single quote can be used instead of an apostrophe in typing, for easier typing.</x-trans>

!!! note "<x-trans>Punctuation and quotes</x-trans>"

    <x-trans>Punctuation marks should be placed only outside the double quotes if they both the sentence inside the quotes and outside of it end at the same time.</x-trans>

<x-trans>Names that come from other languages keep the original spelling if they are written in the latin alphabet, or they have a standard latinisation, and they written phonetically otherwise.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Even though they keep the spelling, they are still pronounced as close as possible to the original language.</x-trans>
<x-trans>As an aid to the reader, a name that comes from another language can be transliterated in Zerita inside square brackets, the first time it appears in a passage, for example "&{george[jorj]}".</x-trans>
