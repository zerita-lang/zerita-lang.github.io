# <x-trans>Questions</x-trans>

<x-trans>Questions in zerita are formed by the question particle + the sentence, in the affirmative syntax, with the unknown part missing.</x-trans>
<x-trans>Yes/no questions, in spoken zerita, have a rising intonation at the end of a sentence.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Question particles</x-trans>

| <x-trans>Particle</x-trans> | <x-trans>English</x-trans>           | <x-trans>Meaning</x-trans>          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| &{ku}                       |                                      | <x-trans>yes/no question</x-trans>  |
| &{ke}                       | <x-trans>who/what</x-trans>          | <x-trans>generic question</x-trans> |
| &{ku치l}                     | <x-trans>which</x-trans>             | <x-trans>choice</x-trans>           |
| &{kove}                     | <x-trans>where</x-trans>             | <x-trans>location</x-trans>         |
| &{kuando}                   | <x-trans>when</x-trans>              | <x-trans>time</x-trans>             |
| &{ku칩t}                     | <x-trans>how much/how many</x-trans> | <x-trans>quantity</x-trans>         |
| &{kume}                     | <x-trans>how</x-trans>               | <x-trans>manner</x-trans>           |

<x-trans>The particles also use the preposition/postposition and declension that is expected.</x-trans>

<x-trans>Interrogative words can be combined with prepositions, for example "&{pro ke}", to ask why something is happening (purpose), or "&{por ke}" to ask for whose benefit something is happening.</x-trans>

!!! note "<x-trans>Handling unknowns</x-trans>"

    <x-trans>In zerita, asking for something, causes the affected suffixes to drop.</x-trans>
    <x-trans>For example, "&{kuanto}" causes the time suffix to drop, or "&{ku칩t}" causes the number suffix or the noun to drop.</x-trans>
    <x-trans>Similarly, "&{ke}" when used to ask for the subject of the verb, it makes the person suffix to drop.</x-trans>
