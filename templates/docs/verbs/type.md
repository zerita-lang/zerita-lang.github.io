# <x-trans>Type</x-trans>

<x-trans>Zerita has a rich type system for verbs, each one having it's own syntactic rules.</x-trans>
<x-trans>The syntax of each sentence stems from the verb and its type.</x-trans>
<x-trans>The basic syntax is VSO.</x-trans>
<x-trans>In cases that the sentence has a topic, it is placed directly after the verb.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Linking verbs</x-trans>

<x-trans>Linking verbs are verbs that don't have an action, but rather they describe an state or a characteristic, for example "I am a doctor" or "The roses smell nice".</x-trans>
<x-trans>Syntax in zerita is verb - subject - attribute, where the attribute is in the predicative case.</x-trans>

1.  _&{olfaves tas rosesis amaresi.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>The roses smell sweet.</x-trans>

<x-trans>One important case in the linking verbs, is introducing oneself, as in "I'm Jon Snow".</x-trans>

1.  _&{seve de me namis jon snow}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>I'm Jon Snow.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Impersonal verbs</x-trans>

<x-trans>Impersonal verbs are verbs that describe the state of the world, of a place, or even a time period.</x-trans>
<x-trans>For example they describe things like "it snows", and they lack subject and the personal suffix.</x-trans>

1.  _&{nivav.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>It is snowing.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Intransitive verbs</x-trans>

<x-trans>Intransitive verbs are verbs that describe an action without a recipient, for example "the birds are singing", or, verbs that describe an state, "the cat is sleeping".</x-trans>
<x-trans>They follow the syntax verb - subject, and the subject is in the nominative case.</x-trans>

1.  _&{kantaves es avisesis.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>Birds are singing.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Transitive verbs</x-trans>

<x-trans>Transitive verbs are verbs that describe an action that has a recipient, for example "I'm drinking water".</x-trans>
<x-trans>They follow the syntax verb - subject - object, the subject is in the nominative case, and the object in the accusative.</x-trans>
<x-trans>The subject can be dropped, especially in the first, second, and fourth person.</x-trans>

1.  _&{potavo e akvon.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>I'm drinking water.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Distransitive verbs</x-trans>

<x-trans>Distransitive verbs are verbs that describe an action with two recipient, for example "I'm giving the book to you".</x-trans>
<x-trans>They follow the syntax verb - subject - direct object - indirect object, the subject is in the nominative case, and the direct object in the accusative and the indirect one is in the dative case.</x-trans>
<x-trans>The subject can be dropped, especially in the first, second, and fourth person.</x-trans>

1.  _&{donavo ta libron veim.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>I am giving the book to you.</x-trans>

1.  _&{donavo ta libron ta filim.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>I am giving the book to the child.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Object promotion</x-trans>

<x-trans>Zerita allows both the direct and the indirect object to be promoted to subject.</x-trans>
<x-trans>This happens with the verb derivation system.</x-trans>

- **<x-trans>IO promotion</x-trans>:** <x-trans>"&{re-}" prefix</x-trans>
- **<x-trans>DO promotion</x-trans>:** <x-trans>"&{ob-}" prefix</x-trans>

<x-trans>After the promotion, the promoted argument is in nominative, and the demoted one in ablative.</x-trans>

1.  _&{potavo e akvon.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>I'm drinking water.</x-trans>

1.  _&{repotave e akvis meic.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>Water is being drunk by me.</x-trans>

1.  _&{obdonavis ta libron meic.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>You are receiving a book from me.</x-trans>

## <x-trans>Reflexivity</x-trans>

<x-trans>In zerita reflexivity and reciprocality are handled with prefixes.</x-trans>
<x-trans>A prefix changes the verb in a reflexive or a reciprocal form.</x-trans>

- **<x-trans>reflexive</x-trans>:** <x-trans>"&{aut-}" prefix</x-trans>
- **<x-trans>reciprocal</x-trans>:** <x-trans>"&{kon-}" prefix</x-trans>

1.  _&{autamores adamo ete maria.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>Adam and Maria love themselves.</x-trans>

1.  _&{konamores adamo ete maria.}_

    - **<x-trans>translation</x-trans>:** <x-trans>Adam and Maria love each other.</x-trans>
